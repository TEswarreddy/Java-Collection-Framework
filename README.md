# Generics in java
Before going to the collections framework we must look at Generics in java and what is Collections in java.
A generic class represents a class that is type-safe. This means a generic class can act upon any data type. Similarly, a generic interface is also type-safe and hence it can use any data type. Generic classes and generic interfaces are also called 'parameterized types' because they use a parameter that determines which data type they should work upon.

Since, generic class acts on any data type, we cannot specify a particular data type when designing the class. In the place of the data type, we use a generic parameter like <T>, or <GT>.

The method becomes a generic method and can act on any data type. To represent the data type, we should use T inside the method

Generic types are designed to act upon objects. Hence they cannot work with primitive data types.
